# Quick Audio Preview for Godot

Written by Yuri Natividade

## What does it do?

Click on a audio asset at the File System tree to play the audio.

## Installation

1. Create an `addons` directory in your Godot project
2. Copy the `addons`>`QuickAudioPreview` folder to your `addons` directory
3. Enable the plugin in `Project Settings | Plugins`

You might need to close and open your editor or open a new script file to start seeing anything working. I don't know why. Pull requests welcome.

Your Godot directory structure should look like this:

```
res://
    addons
        QuickAudioPreview
            ...all the ridiculous coding files...
```
